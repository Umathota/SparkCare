5. After cleansing the data create data model and store the data in the RDBMS.
6. every tables should have 5,6 columns.
7. After storing the data in the RDBMS perform some more transformation tech and store the result into another tables.
8. Use the sqoop to import the data from RDBMS to hdfs.
9. Use some processing engine hive/spark for analytical queries and show the result in visualized form.
10. For visulization you can use the seaborn/matplotlib libr.
